## Production UI Redesign – HuddleUp Platform
This repository documents a frontend UI redesign I implemented as part of an open-source contribution to the HuddleUp sports discussion platform.
The redesign focused on improving usability, discoverability, and interaction clarity across content-heavy user flows without modifying any backend logic or platform functionality.

# Problem Context
The existing interface presented several usability challenges:
- weak visual hierarchy across primary content surfaces
- limited discoverability of creator workflows
- dense discussion layout affecting readability
- insufficient interaction feedback for actionable elements
- inconsistent spacing across route-level containers

These issues impacted navigation clarity and reduced interaction confidence in key flows such as video upload and discussion participation.

# Design Objectives
The redesign aimed to:
- improve content grouping and scanability
- introduce consistent layout spacing
- enhance discussion readability
- standardize typography hierarchy
- provide interaction feedback for user actions
- maintain full compatibility with existing backend logic
